# mcc-code-test-frontend

## First of all
### It requires Expo
### My apologies for not managed to finish all requirements within the time
The requirement of "Query record by daily, weekly or monthly" had been temporary finished as
"Query record by inputing the decided date range"

## Configuring the app
```
src/config/config.js
```
Change the "server" to your server address
